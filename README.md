## Hardware Components
- ELEGOO Nano V3.0 Compatible with Arduino IDE
- GPS Flight Controller Tracking Arduino GPS Module GY-GPS6MV2 NEO6M
- SanDisk 32GB Ultra microSDHC UHS-I Memory Card with Adapter - 120MB/s, C10, U1, Full HD, A1
- Micro SD Card Module SPI for Arduino PIC
- MAX9814 Microphone AGC Amplifier Board Module Auto Gain Control for Arduino
- SPDT Miniature Toggle Switch - Solder Tag
- Elegoo Multicolored Dupont Wire Male to Female, Male to Male, Female to Female Breadboard Jumper Wires Ribbon Cables for arduino
- Red 5mm LED 8mcd Round Diffused

## Running the device
- Turn the power source on: This should start the Arduino, and the sketch starts to run, tracking the GPS location through the GPS module
- When the switch is turned on, the GPS location and timestamp is written to a file in the SD card, and the Microphone starts recording the audio
- When the switch is turned off, the microphone stops recording the audio, and stores it on to the SD card.
- The data can be accessed via the SD card

## Rewriting the Arduino code
- Open the Ardunio (.ino) sketch on the Arduino IDE
- Connect the Arduino via USB
- On MacOS, it is automatically detected over the port
- On Windows, CH340 Driver must be installed: https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-install-ch340-drivers/all for it to be detected on the port
- Upload the sketch to the Arduino, to run it
